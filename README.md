# Introduction
Hello!  My name is Paul Savage.  I am, currently, a Quality Assurance Engineer for JTV Technology.  I primarily write automation tests for our API Gateway for the project my scrum team is currently working on.  

Our automation suite uses Gherkin for Cucumber and Java for the step definitions and business logic.  

This repository contains code I wrote for the automation tests I developed.  This is not a full project, so it will not build, compile or run.  It only contains the specific code I personally wrote.  Please feel free to review this repository as a gauge to my abilities. 

Thank you
