# Introduction
Hello!  My name is Paul Savage.  I am, currently, a Quality Assurance Engineer for JTV Technology.  I primarily write automation tests for our API Gateway for the project my scrum team is currently working on.  

Our automation suite uses Gherkin for Cucumber and Java for the step definitions and business logic.  

This repository contains the code I wrote for the automation tests I developed.  This is not a full project, so it will not build, compile or run.  It is only a sampling of code
